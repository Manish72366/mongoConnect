mkdir src // to make a source folder inside mongoDbregistration
cd src // come inside the src folder
mkdir db
mkdir models
app.js inside the src
connc.js inside the db
now app.js mai work we already did the same
connc.js mai connect with mongoose so the link is basically open the mongoCompass and copy paste the local host and then add a name like jnvMembers .are terminal pe khol do wha pe nucmber hoga 127.0.0.1 use bhi laao

 // for security purpose we have two things 1 -> encryption and hashing 
 // manish -> hkapes -> manish so in encryption there is two way communication so we don't use this as manish stored as hkapes (encoded) but then it can decode easily to manish
 // hashing one way communication means
 // manish -> dhchhjehjchhcjkdhcjdc.chdjck but one problem is that it is based on some algo not randomly it is so some hashing values still can be decode within 2s ex for md5 it is 2s but for some other like bcrypt js hacking could takes more thatn 3yrs
 // so install bcryptjs
